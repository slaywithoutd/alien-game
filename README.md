# Alien Game ðŸ‘½ðŸš€

This is a simple platform game built as part of a university exercise to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Phaser. In the game, a small alien jumps across platforms, collects coins, and uses a turbo boost to navigate the level.

Feel free to check out the code and suggest improvements! ðŸš€
